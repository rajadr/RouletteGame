# Roulette Game
 Console Roulette Game:

Roulette is a popular casino game. The aim of the exercise is to create a simple command line multiplayer version of the game.
On start-up, load a file which contains a list of player's names:

Once started, it should read lines from the console, each line will contain the player's name, what they want to bet on (either a number from
1-36, EVEN or ODD), and how much they want to bet:

The application should support multiple bets from the same user within a round.

Every 30 seconds the game should choose a random number between 0 and 36 (inclusive) for the ball to land on.
 If the number is 1-36 then any bet on that number wins, and the player wins 36x the bet's amount.
 If the number is even, any bet on EVEN wins, and the player wins 2x the bet's amount.
 If the number is odd, any bet on ODD wins, and the player wins 2x the bet's amount.
 All other bets lose.

It must be possible to place bets and choose a random number concurrently.

The game should print to the console the number and for each bet - the player's name, the bet, whether they won or lost, and how much they
won:

Bets are cleared after each betting round.
